;;; Commentary:

;; This mode is very much work in progress.  It does not handle automatic
;; indentation of Shapes programs nor does it offer any motion commands adapted
;; to such.  That said, it does support compilation-mode, flymake-mode,
;; comment-dwim, Imenu, skeleton-pairs, outline-mode (but see documentation for
;; `shapes-outline-regexp') and viewing output through doc-view.
;;
;; TODO
;; - Motion commands
;; - Handle automatic indentation of operators such as <<, &
;; - Hide compilation buffer if a doc-view buffer is visible and there are no
;;errors when recompiling.
;; - PDF sync between source and output (path control points etc).
;; - Automatically pretty-print #, -> (use abbrevs?)
;; - Convert Shapes ref manual to info and hook up to Info-Look
;; - Skeletons?
;; - Eldoc mode?
;; - Some sort of camelCase support a la subword mode of cc-mode
;;
;; LIMITATIONS
;; - Flymake does not make use of column number information
;; - Nested strings are not font-locked correctly (disabled)

;; BUGS
;; - Investigate mismatch between Shapes and Emacs column numbers.
;;   Note: Emacs column 0 means that *point* is before the first char.  Column 1
;; * point is after first char (and the cursor is ON char 2).
;; - Handle the case when shapes-mode is started in a buffer that isn't saved.
;; - Handle the case when shapes-mode is activated on a buffer that doesn't end
;; with .sh(ape|ext), so that its encoding is not set to utf-8 correctly, that
;; is change the buffer encoding to utf-8 if it is set to something else.
;; - Code brackets are indented one column to much, since they are treated as
;; function calls.
;; - The use of forward-sexp for indentation means that some Shapes expressions
;; are not moved over correctly, such as '[...].foldl'.

;;; Installation:

;; To install, put this file somewhere in your load path and just require
;; 'shapes-mode from your ~/.emacs or equivalent, like so:
;;
;; (require 'shapes-mode)

;; Code tested only on GNU Emacs 22 and 23.

;;; Code:

  "Name of the Shapes compiler executable, and any options to pass to it."
  :type 'string)

;; (defcustom shapes-unicode-pretty-print t
;;   "Whether to pretty-print Shapes idenifiers using their Unicode
;; equivalents or not."
;;   :type 'boolean)
