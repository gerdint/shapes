		<p><str-Shapes /> only defines a few states in the initial environment.  Some of these are merely a matter of convenience, while other have a stronger reason for being defined globally â€” while it would make perfect sense to let the output of the program be defined by the last expression in the source (after all, the whole program is just a code bracket without visible delimiters, so this would be to say that <em>the output is defined by the value of the program</em>), states representing communication with the outside world <em>must</em> be defined globally (or else they could not be allowed to change at will).</p>
		<p>The reason <state name="page" /> (and <state name="catalog" />) <em>is</em> defined after all, is that it makes a <str-Shapes /> program easier to read since not every user will have to invent its own name for a state with the same purpose.</p>
