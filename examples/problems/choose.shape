|** The problem here is just to define a function so that we get nice selection from more than two cases.

choose: \ <> cases .>
(escape_continuation leave
		  [cases.foldr \ p e .> [if [typeof e]=/=§Void
									 					 	(escape_continue leave e)
															p
														]
			      void]
)

•stdout << [choose [if 1==2 3] [if '1=='1 4] [if '3=='3 [debuglog_before `Fel!´ 5]]] << `¢n´
