This tool is used to extract a list of local files that are referenced by an xhtml file.

The reason the input must be xhtml is that we use xml tools to do the job.

The xslt file may be applied using Saxon, like this (say we want to find dependencies in the file <tutorial.html>, which in fact is an xml file)

  java -jar your-path-to-Saxon/saxon9.jar tutorial.html your-path-to-here/filter.xsl

The list of dependencies will then be written on stdout.
