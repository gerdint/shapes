This directory contains example output that can be used by all parts of the documentation.  This directory is not placed in the formats directory since is contains stuff common to all formats.  Neither is it placed among the documentation source, in parts, since files here may be referenced from the produced documentation, and we don't want to depend on where the sources are located.  Instead, this directory shall be located side by side with the formats directory.
