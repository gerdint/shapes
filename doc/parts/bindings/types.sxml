<p>At the time of writing, only a few types are directly accessible to the user; while other types are hidden, knowledge of them will still help understanding the language.  When, a binding exist, it will have the same identifier as is used to refer to the type abstractly in the documentation.  Types in the list below are represented with a global binding:</p>
<ul>
	<li><named-type name="Void" /></li>
</ul>
