		<p>Intended to be used as the width when paths are stroked.  A value of <physical><scalar>0</scalar><unit>bp</unit></physical> has a special meaning in <str-PDF />, being that the stroke shall be as thin as possible without dissappearing on the rendering device.  On high resolution printers, this may result in a line which is very hard to read, while such a line shall allways be clearly visible on a computer screen.</p>
