|** This is a file that is used to generate a particular form of the logo.
|**
|** This form of the logo has bent text above and below, and looks rather
|** different from the other logos.  It can be used in printed material like
|** theses, course material, and books.  (The other logos are used in
|** presentations and posters.)
